# MORINGA SCHOOL PHASE 3 FINAL PROJECT

<h1>Welcome To Portfoli-YOU!</h1>

1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
+ This project is titled "Portfoli-YOU"

+ It is an app that acts as a hub for artists to join, share, like and delete artworks. This is acheived by creating website that meets this functionality that uses React logic in the frontend and the use of Active Record and Sinatra in the backend.

+ Therefore, this application is split into two main repositories: one for the frontend and one for the backend. This specific one is for the frontend.

2. PROJECT SETUP

    + #1. <code>index.html</code> - Complies the webpage into one document
    + #2. <code>index.js</code> - Compiles the webpage into one JavaScript file

+ The rest of the important files such as the components and the App.js are spread across different folders in the application directory.

+ To install the project, open your terminal and copy the following to a directory:

    <code>git@github.com:Alex-Njagi/phase-3-portfoli-YOU-frontend.git</code>

+ Then navigate to the appropriate directory and in the terminal and type the following to launch the frontend application:
